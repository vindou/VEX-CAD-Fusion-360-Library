# VRC Fusion 360 Library

---

## [Latest Release: 2.0.0](https://github.com/VEX-CAD/VEX-CAD-Fusion/releases/tag/v1.0.0)

This parts library is the second iteration of the original [Fusion 360 Library](https://github.com/VEX-CAD/VEX-CAD-Fusion/releases/tag/v1.0.0). The library features every VRC legal part currently available, and will continue to be updated as new parts get released. 

### Installation
To install the parts library, download the zip file and follow this video tutorial. 

### Changes
Most notably, the [Fusion 360 Add-In](https://github.com/vexcad/fusion-library/releases/download/v1.0.0/fusion_addin_1_0_0.zip) is *no longer supported*, however there are plans to re-implement the add-in in the future. 

There are now files for *every length* of structure, similar to the [Inventor library](https://github.com/VEX-CAD/VEX-CAD-Inventor/releases/tag/v1.4.0), and all motion pieces that support inserts now have individual files for every type of insert, including no insert.

Additionally, every available length for spacers, screws, and standoffs are now available.
