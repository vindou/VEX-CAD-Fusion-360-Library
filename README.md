# VRC Fusion 360 Library
## [Latest Release: 2.0.0](https://github.com/VEX-CAD/VEX-CAD-Fusion/releases/tag/v1.0.0)

This parts library is the second iteration of the original [Fusion 360 Library](https://github.com/VEX-CAD/VEX-CAD-Fusion/releases/tag/v1.0.0). The library features each and every VRC legal part currently available, and will continue to be updated as new parts get released. 

## Changes
Most notably, the [Fusion 360 Add-In](https://github.com/vexcad/fusion-library/releases/download/v1.0.0/fusion_addin_1_0_0.zip) is **no longer supported**. There are plans in the future to potentially support the add-in, however that is not currently on the table.
