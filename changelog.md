# Changelog
## Version 2.0.0

In version 2.0.0 we've reorganized the folders that files are grouped into, so now we have 5 folders: Electronics, Field Elements, Hardware, Motion, and Structure. We've also stopped supporting the add-in from version 1.0.0, so motion components will come in separate files with all the different inserts, and structure as well as hardware components will come in every length possible. 
#### Electronics
- Added 5.5W motors
- Created new simple electronic models that contain only visible components instead of simplifying the entire component.
- Added the VEX V5 GPS sensor, the VEX V5 Rotational sensor, the VEX V5 5.5N bumper switch, and the V2 potentiometer. 
#### Field Elements
- Added standalone files for tiles, triballs, the match load station, the goal, as well as the barrier and high posts.
- Included a simplified full field CAD, as well as a full field CAD with the portable competition perimeter. 
#### Hardware
- Included different varieties of Robosource shoulder screws available.
- Included both lengths of 6-32 steel screws available (0.25", 0.5")
- Added Nylock Flange Nut, Nylon Flange Nut, and Low Profile Nut.
- Fixed retainer models to be flat, removing the hexagonal indent that's present on the original models. 
#### Motion
- Changed the wheel rubber on all wheel files to a gray that resembles the texture being used on the new antistatic omniwheels and traction wheels. 
- Added all unmodified varieties of VRC legal flex wheels (30A, 45A, 60A and their corresponding diameters). 
- Added 6P sprockets and v2 of the high strength gears
- Added antistatic omniwheels and traction wheels
- Changed the acetal green texture previously found on numerous plastic components in the VEX ecosystem to the new acetal red that new VEX products have been shipping with.
#### Structure
- Included new varieties of gussets introduced by VEX, grouping them into 30, 45, 60, and 90 degree folders respectively within the larger gussets folder.
